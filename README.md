# Chelm-Molarizer
Chelm-Molarizer was a quick-and-dirty project to break down chemical statements in a functional way and to return the equivalent number of mols of material. 
_(e.g. 1 kilogram of gold is "1" "kg" "Au", which the application converts to 5 mols of gold.)_
It was built in the developer's freshman year in college to aid in his introductory chemistry course. The project has since fallen into abandonment.
